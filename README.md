## Setup
To integrate Hi-Jack-Mocker into your Android project, follow these steps:

### Adding the Dependency

You can add the project dependency using the following code:

```groovy
debugImplementation("io.github.koreatlwls:hjm:0.1.5")
```
ðŸš¨ Note: This dependency must be added with `debugImplementation` and should not be included in the release environment.

### Initialize Hi-Jack-Mocker in your application:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    HiJackMocker.initialize(this)
}
```
Add the above code in the onCreate method of your Application class.

### Configure OkHttpClient:

When creating your OkHttpClient instance, include the `addHiJackMocker()` method </br>
ðŸš¨ Note : When using HttpLoggingInterceptor, the order in which interceptors are added is important. You should add `addHiJackMocker()` first, followed by adding HttpLoggingInterceptor.

```kotlin
@Provides
@Singleton
fun provideHttpClient(): OkHttpClient =
    OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .readTimeout(TEN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .connectTimeout(TEN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .writeTimeout(TEN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .addHiJackMocker()
        .addInterceptor(getLoggingInterceptor())
        .build()
```
## Usage
To enable or disable the Hi-Jack-Mocker mode, use the ImageButton provided at the top of every activity. 

This allows you to control whether the hjm mode is active.
